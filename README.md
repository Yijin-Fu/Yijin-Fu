Nice to meet all of you here. My name is Yijin. I possess eight years of higher education experience in Canada and the United States. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and a Masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics from the United States. Beyond my expertise in STEM fields, I also delve into brand management and marketing analytics within the Canadian market.

As an experienced marketing data analyst, I have four years of experience using business intelligence software such as Tableau and Power BI. Additionally, I am highly proficient in utilizing SQL, Python, and R programming languages to navigate complex data. My keen attention to detail, coupled with solid skills and a rapid learning ability, allows me to quickly extract business insights from data.

I am deeply enthusiastic about conducting thorough market research, copywriting, and storytelling. With a focus on the e-commerce sector, I bring two years of experience leveraging social media channels such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram for marketing purposes and analyzing digital data to stay abreast of trends. This enables me to identify beneficial opportunities for many companies. As a strategic marketer, I excel in identifying opportunities and resolving marketing challenges using scientific methods.
